                              widmet sich den Stilen des Hatha Yoga
                              (traditionell und modern, mit und ohne Verwendung
                              von Requisiten), Vinyasa und gibt gleichzeitig
                              einen kurzen Einblick in die Tradition des
                              Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga. Nachdem die Teilnehmer die
                              200h Yogalehrer Ausbildung erfolgreich
                              abgeschlossen haben, sind sie mehr als bereit,
                              Hatha und Vinyasa zu kombinieren und es geschickt
                              zu unterrichten. Werfen wir einen Blick auf diese
                              Traditionen und was du von ihr erwarten kannst, da
                              die Terminologie heutzutage aufgrund von

                              ist eine langsame Praxis, die traditionelle

                              kombiniert. In unserer heutigen Gesellschaft
                              konzentrieren sich die Kurse jedoch oft nur auf
                              die Körperhaltung. Der Stil verwendet auch
